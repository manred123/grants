Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine which can be installed manually on your node or you can create a domain on the cloud by using AWS Elasticsearch, below are basic Elasticsearch commands which you can run from any Linux server which has an open access to the Elasticsearch node:

#1 Check your Elasticsearch cluster health: (replace below bold/colored Elasticsearch node with your AWS node or localhost if you are running it from your direct installed instance)

_cat/health?v -- This parameter which used to inquiry the health of the node.

curl 'search-dotsways-fwtnmygdotwtsy2wvmumradkqa.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/_cat/health?v'
Sample output:

epoch timestamp cluster status node.total node.data shards pri relo init unassign pending_tasks max_task_wait_time active_shards_percent
1492895570 14:12:50 513643930529:dotsways green 2 2 42 21 0 0 0 0 -- 100.0%
#2 List AWS Elasticsearch nodes

_cat/nodes?v -- Is used to list the Elasticsearch nodes

curl  'replace-with-your-node-name/_cat/nodes?v'
Sample output:

ip heap.percent ram.percent cpu load_1m load_5m load_15m node.role master name
x.x.x.x 14 98 2 0.03 0.10 0.13 mdi -- bcqocrw
x.x.x.x 14 97 2 0.06 0.11 0.11 mdi * WDBCOid
 

#3 Create new index

 /usersz/external/1 -- Usersz is the name of the new index we want to create.
?pretty -- Is used to have a clean output in separate likes.

Then i am passing a JSON format which has a name of dotsway and a type of website.

curl -XPUT  'replace-with-your-node-name/usersz/external/1?pretty' -d
'{
"name": "Dotsway",
"type":"website"
}'
Sample output:

{
"_index" : "usersz",
"_type" : "external",
"_id" : "1",
"_version" : 1,
"result" : "created",
"_shards" : {
"total" : 2,
"successful" : 1,
"failed" : 0
},
"created" : true
}
 

#4 List indices 

/_cat/indices?v -- Is used to list the Elasticsearch indices

curl  'replace-with-your-node-name/_cat/indices?v'
Sample output:

health status index uuid pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green open example exXUF8zyR1WLMEAY5Lw5SA 5 1 0 0 1.2kb 650b

#5 Retrieving:

curl -XGET 'replace-with-your-node-name/customer/external/1?pretty'
7. Delete an index:

curl -XDELETE 'replace-with-your-node-name/customer?pretty'
Those are the basic AWS Elasticsearch commands which can get you started and test the service.
